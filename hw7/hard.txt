Alright, hear me out...
You're looking for Waldo so you can delete him. Waldo is a number, and he's in a tree. A binary search tree, to be exact.

But wait, you say, how do I remove Waldo from the tree?
Well, first, you need to find him. See medium.py for how to do that.
Once you find him, you can delete him.

But wait, you say, what if Waldo has children?
Well, in that case, you need to convince his neighbors to adopt his children first.

So how do you do that?
It's quite simple, really.
First, check if Waldo has a left or right child. If he doesn't, you're done!
If he has one or the other, simply set his value to that child's value and delete the child.

If you're in the unfortunate situation where Waldo has two children, you need to find the smallest child in his right subtree and set Waldo to that value.
Then, you need to delete that child.

And that's it! You've successfully removed Waldo from the tree.

...but did you? Did you find the correct Waldo?
Who even IS Waldo? He could be anyone...
He could be you, he could be me, he could be the next person in line at the DMV.
And why was he in a tree in the first place?
The world may never know.
